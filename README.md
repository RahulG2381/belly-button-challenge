## Belly-button-challenge: Interactive dashboard using javascript
## Project Overview:
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels and reveals that a few microbial species are present in more than 70% of people, while others are relatively rare.

## Technology Used:

<b>Programming language:</b> javascript, HTML <br />
<b>Package used:</b> Plotly, D3.js <br />
<b>Main script:</b> [app.js](https://github.com/RahulG2381/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js), [index.html](https://github.com/RahulG2381/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/index.html)<br />
<b>Dataset:</b> [samples.json](https://github.com/RahulG2381/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/samples.json)


## Tasks:

The main tasks involve using the D3 library to read samples.json, Plotly is used to create a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in an individual, and a bubble chart displaying each sample's data. Additionally, display the sample metadata (demographic information) and update all plots when a new sample is selected.A gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual, modifying the gauge code to accommodate values ranging from 0 through 9.
